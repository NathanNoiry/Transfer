# Transfer Learning: A Semi-Parametric Approach

Companion code for the paper Transfer Learning: A Semi-Parametric Approach. Two numerical experiments are available.

<h2>Artificial Data</h2>
One can tune the parameters of the model in the parameters.py file.</br>
Run the main.py file to obtain the results, which will be stored in the "results" directory (in csv format).

<h2>Life Expectancy Dataset</h2>
One can tune the paramaters of the model in the expec_parameters.py file.</br>
Run the expec_main.py file to obtain the results, which will be stored in the "results" directory (in csv format).

<h2>Virtual Environment</h2>
Create a virtual environment and install the needed packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
